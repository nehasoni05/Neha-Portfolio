                    <h3><b>My Experience</b></h3>
                    <p class="text">  
                     I have successfully completed 30 days of web development organized by <b>Developer Student Club</b>
                    and learnt lot of things about web development with in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Hosting and Firebase.
                    It was an amazing learning experience and entire team was Very Helpful and Supportive.
                    <h3><b>About Members and Community</b></h3>

                 <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Things I have Learned in these 30 days-</b></h3><br>
                 <h4>1) GITHUB
                    <p class="text">Learnt github by actually performing git clone, fetching files, making some changes and merging them with remote code. Learnt about commands like push, pull, branching, status.</p>
                 </h4>
                     <h4>2) HTML
                        <p class="text"><b>HTML</b> is the most basic building block in the web development process, and thatâ€™s what makes it so critical to learn.
                          It tells browsers which part of a webpage is a header, which is a footer, where paragraphs belong, where images, graphics, and videos are placed, etc.
                          I have learned all the basics of HTML in these 30 days</p>
                     </h4>
                     <h4>3) CSS
                        <p class="text">If you want to create sophisticated pages, which are very close to client demands or to create some innovative approach, you MUST 
                           know <b>CSS. </b>A Style Sheet(CSS) is a collection of style rules that that tells a browser how the various styles are to be applied to the HTML tags to present the document.
                        I have learned lot of things in CSS and also created a beautiful portfolio </p>
                     </h4>
                     
                     <h4>4) BOOTSTRAP
                        <p class="text">If you want to quickly create a website without writing tons of CSS, then <b>Bootstrap</b> 
                           might be the framework youâ€™re looking for. Youâ€™ll style and populate your site using Bootstrapâ€™s utility
                            classes and components. With Bootstrap, HTML, some familiarity with CSS youâ€™ll be making websites in no time. </p>
                     </h4>
                     <h4>5) JAVASCRIPT
                        <p class="text"><b>JavaScript</b> is the most popular programming language used by professional developers today.
                            Even back-end developers choose JavaScript more often than not. JavaScript is easy to pick up.
                           It turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer and we can do amazing stuffs with Javascript.</p>
                     </h4>
                     <h4>6) FIREBASE
                        <p class="text"><b>Firebase</b> is a backend platform for building Web, Android and IOS applications. It offers
                            real time database, different APIs, multiple authentication types and hosting platform.In this bootcamp, 
                           I got to know about how to deploy your website using firebase console.  </p>
                     </h4>

                     <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Learning by Yourself</b></h3>
                     <p class="text">Yes, itâ€™s possible to learn this all by yourself. You can even get together with some people
                        to build projects, all without paying a dime. Thousands have done this using sites such as FreeCodeCamp.
                        Personally, I donâ€™t think a year of self-study would have taught me as much as my bootcamp did in one month.</p>
